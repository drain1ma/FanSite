## Project Overview 
The current goal of this project is to provide a fun environment for those interested in the Final Fantasy franchise. As of right now, there is user authentication and users are capable of adding screenshots, or really, any images onto the site as long as they are logged in.

## Website Functionality

This page is capable of displaying the images the users store from the sql database. Currently, users are able to look at their own uploaded screenshots with the "Your Screenshots" page. The goal is to also have a upvote/downvote system for the screenshots which is currently being worked on as well.

Currently, the code that I have within the project is only capable of enlarging the first image within the database. The functionality is there but the issue at hand is working on enlargin all images that are listed rather than only the first one. Once that is implemented it will be a nice addition to the site so that users can better view the screenshots that others upload. It is possible that in the future the enlarged image will be made a tad bit larger.
