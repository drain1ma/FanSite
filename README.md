## Project Overview 
The current state of the site includes user authentication, where users can upload screenshots to the screenshot page as well as an interactive forum between users. 

## Website Functionality

This page is capable of displaying the images the users store from the sql database as well as uses Azure Blob storage to store the images. Currently, users are able to look at their own uploaded screenshots with the "Your Screenshots" page. The goal is to also have a upvote/downvote system for the screenshots which is currently being worked on as well.

Currently, the code that I have within the project is now capable of enlarging all the images within the database. It currently allows users to do that using javascript and jQuery within the html document. Users are also able to add profile pictures to their profiles, and I am currently working on having the profile picture display with whatever the user posts to the site.
