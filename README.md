## Project Overview 
The current goal of this project is to provide a fun environment for those interested in the Final Fantasy franchise. As of right now, there is user authentication and users are capable of adding screenshots, or really, any images onto the site as long as they are logged in.

## Website Functionality

This page is capable of displaying the images the users store from the sql database. Currently, users are able to look at their own uploaded screenshots with the "Your Screenshots" page. The goal is to also have a upvote/downvote system for the screenshots which is currently being worked on as well.

Currently, the code that I have within the project is now capable of enlarging all the images within the database. It currently allows users to do that using javascript and jQuery within the html document. Users are also able to add profile pictures to their profiles, and I am currently working on having the profile picture display with whatever the user posts to the site.
